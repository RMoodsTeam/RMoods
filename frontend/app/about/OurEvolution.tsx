                    Throughout our project, we have faced numerous challenges, from technical obstacles to data interpretation issues.
                    However, each challenge has been an opportunity for growth and improvement. Our project has evolved significantly,
                    with continuous enhancements to our NLP models and data analysis techniques. Today, we are proud of the progress we have
                    made and the insights we have uncovered.
